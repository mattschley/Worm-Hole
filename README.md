This is a project I made for EECS 351 at Northwestern. It is a game created using WebGL. The object is to stop the rectangles spinning in the middle of the screen in such a way that the smaller rectangles are hidden behind the largest one. After a successful stop, you should advance to the next level. It becomes more difficult to stop the rectangles as you advance to subsequent levels. 

Feel free to download the three files and play the game yourself. Make sure the html file refrences the right path when you download to your machine.
