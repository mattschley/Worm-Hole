WormHole

This is a project I made for EECS 351 at Northwestern. It is a game created using WebGL. The object is to stop the rectangles spinning in the middle of the screen in such a way that the smaller rectangles are hidden behind the largest one. After a successful stop, you should advance to the next level. It becomes more difficult to stop the rectangles as you advance to subsequent levels.
